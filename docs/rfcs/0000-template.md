# RFC NNNN: [Feature Name]

- **Start Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **RFC PR:** #NNNN
- **Tracking Issue:** #NNNN

## Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Detailed Design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail that:
- Its interaction with other features is clear
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented
- Corner cases are dissected by example

### Syntax (if applicable)

\\\ssl
// Example code showing the new syntax
\\\

### Semantics

How does it behave? What are the edge cases?

### Implementation

Outline of implementation approach (which files, which components).

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Alternatives

- What other designs have been considered?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior Art

Discuss how other languages solve this problem:
- Rust: ...
- Python: ...
- Haskell: ...

## Unresolved Questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope?

## Future Possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect the language as a whole.
