**Last Updated:** January 19, 2026

## 1. Introduction
Sonne Studio Language v9 ("SSL v9") is a programming language runtime and development tool developed by Jan Friske. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any data you process using our software.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage
**SSL v9 does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The application runs entirely locally on your device. Any code, scripts, or applications you write or execute using SSL v9 remain on your local machine unless you explicitly choose to share them. We do not collect telemetry, usage statistics, or crash reports.

## 3. Network Access
SSL v9 includes capabilities for network communication (e.g., loading assets, HTTP requests) as part of its feature set for developers. These features only function when explicitly invoked by the code you write or execute. We do not monitor, intercept, or log these communications.

## 4. Local Storage
SSL v9 may store configuration files or compiled binaries on your local storage to function correctly. You have full control over these files.

## 5. Third-Party Services
The application does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
